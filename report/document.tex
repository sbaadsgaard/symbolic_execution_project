\begin{abstract}
	Symbolic execution is a technique for systematically exploring all execution paths of a program, and for each path generate concrete input values that will execute along this path. This serves as a strong tool for testing programs, as it is often difficult to come up with a proper selection of testing inputs that cover the entire program. We describe the theory behind symbolic execution and discuss a number of limitations to the technique, such as the path-explosion problem, and the ability to decide which paths are feasible. Furthermore we describe a different technique called concolic execution, that combines concrete and symbolic execution to mitigate some of the challenges of pure symbolic execution. Finally, we demonstrate symbolic execution by describing and comparing an implementation of both a concrete and symbolic interpreter for a small toy language.
