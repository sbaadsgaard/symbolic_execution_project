\subsection*{Project Description (at least 10-20 lines)}
%NOTE this is simply the text from the project proposal document. May be subject to change.
Testing programs thoroughly requires good selections of input values, to make sure that all corner 
cases of the programs are reached. Symbolic execution is a classic technique for automatically 
obtaining such input values. Instead of running programs using
concrete values, it uses symbolic 
expressions together with automated theorem proving tools. Within the last decade, a variant 
called directed automated random testing, which combines concrete and symbolic execution, has 
become widely used. In this project we will investigate these techniques, starting with classic symbolic execution and moving on to more modern approaches. We will review and discuss research papers within this field, and we will also be working on a small prototype tool to perform symbolic execution on a simple toy language that we design. 

This gives the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
	\item -1: Design a toy language for the prototype tool. And make a concrete interpreter for it. 
	\item 0: Review the literature and summarize the ideas and techniques presented in them.
	\item A: Implementation of basic symbolic execution in the prototype tool.
	\item B: Extending the prototypes with other techniques, and possibly extend the toy language.
	\item C: Discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the different methods used. What are their strengths and limitations? 
\end{itemize}
